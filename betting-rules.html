                        1. These Betting Rules are inseparably linked to our Terms &amp; Conditions, of which they form a part, and
                        acceptance of these Betting Rules is a prerequisite to account registration. Any capitalized terms used herein
                        which are not defined shall take their meaning from the Terms &amp; Conditions.
                        <br>2. The minimum amount for a bet is £/€0.10. Your maximum amount for a bet differs between sports, leagues
                        and
                        bets. You will see the exact value specified in the field where you enter the stake amount, when placing a bet.
                        We make no guarantee that any bet placed within or for the maximum stake shall be accepted.
                        <br>3. Fun88 reserves right to refuse the whole or any part of any bet request for any reason and at our
                        sole discretion. Individual bet requests may be reviewed and an alternative price or stake offered at our sole
                        discretion.
                        <br>4. Fun88 accepts bets made online. Bets are not accepted in any other form (email, telephone, fax,
                        etc.) and if received will be void, win or lose.
                        <br>5. Fun88 reserves the right to refuse/cancel any bet or part of a bet before the game starts and to
                        make ambiguous bets void, without providing any justification.
                        <br>6. Customers cannot cancel or change a bet once the bet has been placed and confirmed.
                        <br>7. Bets will be accepted up to the advertised start time. If a bet is inadvertently accepted which includes
                        an event after its start time, unless it is a live-betting event, the match/bet will be treated as a non-runner.
                        <br>8. Irrespective of which betting odds format you select for odds to be shown in your Customer account, all
                        bets will be settled based on American odds.
                        <br>9. Where we have reason to believe that a bet is placed after the outcome of an event is known or after the
                        selected participant or team has gained a material advantage (e.g. a score, sending off etc.) we reserve the
                        right to void the bet, win or lose.
                        <br>10. Fun88 reserves the right to cancel any bets from customers who place money on an event where they
                        are
                        in any way involved, as participants, referee, coach etc.
                        <br>11. Fun88 reserves the right to withhold payment and to declare bets on an event void if we have
                        evidence
                        that the following has occurred: (i) the integrity of the event has been called into question or (ii)
                        matchrigging has taken place. Evidence may be based on the size, volumes or pattern of bets placed with
                        Fun88 across any or all of our betting channels.
                        <br>12. When an event is cancelled, all related bets will be void automatically and accounts refunded.
                        <br>13. If any match is abandoned due to injury, bad weather, crowd trouble etc. all bets that have already been
                        settled up until the time of abandonment will stand. For example: If a football match is abandoned in the second
                        half, all bets involving the 1st half will stand. What’s more, if there has been a goal scored, the first goal
                        scorer market will stand, but the last and any time goal scorer bets will be void. For tennis: if a player
                        retires injured in the 3rd set, all bets to win the 1st and 2nd sets will stand.
                        <br>14. Fun88 does not accept any responsibility for typing, human or palpable errors, which lead to
                        obvious
                        price errors. In such cases all bets will be deemed void.
                        <br>15. Multiple bets that combine different selections within the same event are not accepted where the outcome
                        of
                        one affects or is affected by the other. If such a bet is taken in error, the bet will be cancelled.
                        <br>16. Fun88 offers you the ability to bet in play on a variety of global sporting events and while we do
                        make
                        every effort to ensure all live betting information is accurate, there may be situations where such information
                        is incorrect, due to delays or otherwise. When checking live betting odds, live event start times or any other
                        live event markets, please be aware that such information is provided as a guide only and we accept no liability
                        for the outcome of any inaccuracies which may occur. It is the sole responsibility of the customer to check such
                        information is accurate at the time of publication.
                        <br>17. The official result is final for settlement purposes except where specific rules state the contrary. The
                        podium position in Grand Prix racing, the medal ceremony in athletics and any similar official ceremony or
                        presentation in other sports are to be treated as the official result.
                        <br>18. Winnings will be credited to the Customer’s account following confirmation of the final result.
                        <br>19. Fun88 reserves the right to void any or all bets made by any person or group of persons acting in
                        an
                        attempt to defraud us.
                        <br>20. Fun88 reserves the right to void any bet that may have been accepted when the account did not have
                        sufficient funds to cover the bet. If an account has insufficient funds as a result of a deposit that has been
                        cancelled by the payment processing party, Fun88 reserves the right to cancel any bet that may have been
                        accepted retroactively.
                        <br>21. The maximum total winnings to any customer on any calendar day for bets placed with Fun88 is
                        £100,000.00 or equivalent (hereafter the “Maximum Daily Payout”.
                        <br>22. Fraud and Collusion:
                        <br>a. A number of bets may be treated as being one when a Customer places multiple copies of the same bet. When
                        this occurs all bets may be voided apart from the first bet struck. A number of bets that contain the same
                        single selection may be treated as being one. When this occurs all bets may be voided apart from the first bet
                        struck. An example would be where 1 particular selection is repeatedly included in Multiple bets involving other
                        short-priced selections.
                        <br>b. Where there is evidence of a series of bets each containing the same (or very similar) selection(s)
                        having been placed by or for the same individual or syndicate or individuals, Fun88 reserves the right to
                        make bets void and suspend relevant accounts. This rule applies to both settled and unsettled bets.
                        <br>c. If you have played in a professional capacity, or in tandem with other Customer(s) as part of a club,
                        group, etc., or placed bets or wagers in a coordinated manner with other Customer(s) involving the same (or
                        materially the same) selections; in this instance we further reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to
                        restrict the total maximum pay out for the combined total of any such bets, to the equivalent of the Maximum
                        Daily Payout limit permitted for a single Customer (as outlined at section 17 above). Fun88 is for sole use
                        on an individual basis and for personal entertainment only.
                        <br>d. Fun88 allows only one account per person. Any subsequent accounts opened under the same
                        postcode/personal details/IP address that are found to be related to any existing account may be closed
                        immediately and any bets will be voided at Fun88's discretion. Fun88 reserves the right to reclaim any
                        winnings attained by these means and we reserve the right to withhold all or part of your balance and/or recover
                        from your account deposits, pay outs, bonuses, any winnings that are attained by these means.

                      <p class="f-1">All match markets are based on the result at the end of the regular time. This includes any added injury or
                        stoppage time but does not include extra time, time allocated for a penalty shootout or a golden goal.
                        <br>Video Assistant Referee (VAR) will be taken into account. Decisions made after a significant event occurs,
                        may result in confirmed bets being voided. Bets voided will be from the time of the significant event, until the
                        time the final VAR decision was officially announced.
                        <br>An exception is made when this rule relates to friendly matches. In such cases, all match markets are
                        settled based on the actual result at the end of the game (excluding any extra time), irrespective of whether
                        the full 90 minutes is played. This rule applies only to matches with regular playing time of two 45-minute
                        halves.
                        <br>Some Soccer matches may have different playing schedules. In that case the following will apply:
                        <br>• 90 minutes scheduled play (3 x 30 minutes). Full-time bets are still considered valid. Half-time bets are
                        considered void.
                        <br>• 80 minutes scheduled play (2 x 40 minutes). All bets are still considered valid.
                        <br>• If the playing schedule is different from the above stated, all bets are void.
                        <br>Should any match be played prior to the date or kick-off time denoted then bets will stand provided the
                        wager is placed not later than the revised kick-off time.
                        <br>Bets on a match or qualification are not affected if a team is subsequently disqualified from, or
                        re-instated to the competition.
                        All bets on a match abandoned before the completion of the regular time will be void unless the match is
                        rearranged and played on the same date (local time) or stated otherwise in the rules, except for bets on any
                        markets that have been unconditionally determined.
                        <br>If the game does not take place as scheduled and is not played on the same date (local time) all bets are
                        void. An exception is made if incorrect kick-off time is announced on our website.
                        <br>If a match venue is changed then bets already placed will stand providing the home team is still designated
                        as such. If the home and away team for a listed match are reversed then bets based on the original listing will
                        be void.
                        <br>Bets will stand if we list a team name without specifying the term 'XI' in the name.
                        <br>In the absence of an official source, or when significant conflicting evidence is present, bets will be
                        settled based on our own statistics.</p>

                        <br>If a penalty is awarded, but not taken (referee changes his decision, the game is abandoned before the

                        <br>If a match is abandoned after the first goal is scored all bets will stand. If a match is abandoned before
                        the first goal is scored, or a game finishes without any goals being scored, all bets will be void. As soon as a
                        game kicks off it will be deemed to be in the first minute. So for example a goal scored after 24 minutes and 16
                        seconds will be settled as scored in the 25th minute.</p>

                      <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-primary f-1">Gameplay specifics</h4>
                      <p class="f-1">Scoring à Points = Goals (scores 6 points) + Behinds (score 1 point)
                        <br>Like many other codes of football, the way to score points is to score goals. In Australian Football, there
                        are
                        two
                        types of scores: a goal and a behind.
                        <br>A goal umpire judges whether a goal or behind is scored.</p>
                      <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-primary f-1">Game length</h4>
                      <p class="f-1">The length of a game of Australian Football can vary from league to league, but is generally around 15 to 25
                        minutes
                        per quarter. In the AFL, each quarter runs for 20 minutes plus time on – which makes up for time occupied in
                        stoppages, such as when the ball going out of bounds, injuries, goals (or behinds) being kicked, or when the
                        umpire
                        is setting the angle of a free kick on goal. Time is kept by two off-field officials, known as "timekeepers",
                        who
                        sound the siren at the start and end of each quarter. A typical AFL quarter might run from 27 to 33 minutes, but
                        may
                        be even longer if, for instance, injuries cause delays. AFL breaks after the first and third quarters are six
                        minutes, with a 20-minute break at halftime.[5] Thus, a match with quarters averaging 30 minutes would last
                        about
                        two and a half hours.</p>

                        <br><br>MLB Player Props Rules <br>On any prop, the player(s) must
                        start, and either throw at least one pitch (if pitchers) or have at least
                        one plate appearance (if position players) in the designated game for the
                        wager to have action. <br>On any batting props, the opposing listed
                        pitcher must start and throw at least one pitch for the wager to have
                        action. <br>For any props to have action, the game must go at least 9
                        innings (8.5 innings if home team are ahead), unless the outcome has been
                        determined and at least 5 innings have been played (4.5 innings if home
                        team are ahead). <br>For Total Bases Propositions, a batter is only
                        credited for total bases if he hits a single (1 base), double (2 bases),
                        triple (3 bases), or home run (4 bases). <br>Pitcher propositions “Total
                        Runs Allowed” include both earned and unearned runs. <br>Head to head
                        player props for a specific game will have action as long as those players
                        start and the game becomes official.

                      <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-primary f-1">What is an Each-Way bet?</h4>
                      <p class="f-1">An Each-Way (E/W) bet is a bet consisted of two separate parts - a win part and a place part. The win part of the
                        bet is on your selection to win the event, and the place part is on your selection to finish either first or
                        within the race's specified place terms (e.g. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc). The bet is very popular in horse racing since
                        it allows you to gain returns even if your horse doesn't finish first.
                      </p>

                      <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-primary f-1">How do Each-Way bets work?</h4>
                      <p class="f-1">When you place an Each-Way bet (by ticking the e/w check box), your stake is doubled, with half allocated to the
                        outright win, and the other half allocated to your runner finishing within the place terms. Each race has
                        specified place terms depending on the number of runners, eg. ¼ 1-2-3. In this example, an Each-Way bet placed
                        on a runner that finishes 1st will pay in two ways: you will win the outright portion of the bet, but you will
                        also win the place portion at ¼ the outright odds as it finished in the top 3.
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Example:</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>You place a 2 GBP Each-Way bet on a 12/1 shot in a race with E/W terms ¼ 1-2-3
                        <br>
                        <br>If your selection finishes 1st:
                        <br>
                        <br>- You win 12 GBP plus your stake for the outright win
                        <br>- You also win 3 GBP (quarter the outright odds: 3/1) plus your stake for placing (ie. finishing in the top
                        3)
                        <br>
                        <br>If your selection finishes 2nd or 3rd:
                        <br>
                        <br>- The outright portion of the bet will lose
                        <br>- You win 3 GBP plus your stake for placing
                        <br>
                        <br>If your selection finishes outside the place terms for the race, both bets lose.
                      </p>

                      <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-primary f-1">How do Each-Way Accumulators work?</h4>
                      <p class="f-1">In the case of settling Each-Way Accumulators, the win portion of the first bet will be carried over to the win
                        portion of the following bet, and similarly, the each-way portion of the bet will be carried over to the
                        each-way portion of the following bet.
                        <br>
                        <br>Example:
                        <br>You place a 1 GBP e/w accumulator on selection A in Race A and selection B in Race B. This means you have an
                        outright (win) accumulator and a place accumulator
                        <br>If selection A wins and selection B only places, the outright portion of the accumulator will lose, but the
                        place portion will win.
                        <br>If selection A only places and selection B wins, again, the outright portion of the accumulator will lose,
                        but the place portion will win.

                        can move the point-spread so you get more points when betting the underdog, and fewer points when betting on the
                        favourite. You can move the total so you get a higher total when betting the under or a lower total if betting
                        the over.

                        horse be awarded the race or promoted to a place, as a result of a Stewards' Inquiry or Objection which is
                        announced before the 'Weigh In', we will also pay you.
                        <br>All bets placed on UK and Irish horse racing will be settled on First Past the Post AND the official result
                        (i.e. the Weighed In result). The rules will be applied so that the settlement is always in the favour of the
                        customer.
                        <br>• First Past the Post: The immediate result after the race has been completed (see Exceptions below).
                        <br>• Official Result: Announced at the 'Weigh In' on the day, after any Stewards' Inquiries and/or Objections
                        have been considered. If a winner or a placed horse is disqualified/demoted after the official result is
                        announced, the disqualification/demotion will not affect the settlement of bets.
                        <br><b>General</b>

                      these cases, we can alter the standard place terms as set out above (e.g. we may offer to pay out 5 or 6 places
                      in a handicap with 16 or more runners but to do so at 1/5 of the odds as opposed to standard 1/4). <br>These
                      promotions are not confined to handicaps. The onus is on the customer at all times to check the each way terms
                      on offer (particularly in those races where we are offering additional place payouts). In the event of
                      subsequent non-runners in the race we reserve the right to apply the industry standard terms for the race

                        involves a dead heat winner, the win part of the bet will be settled as above, and the place part will be
                        settled in full, in accordance with the relevant place terms. Should the dead heat involve placed selections and
                        results in more than the allocated number of places, then the stakes will be divided as before, and settled to
                        the full place terms.</p>

                        <br>Ante post events may be suspended on days when races related to the event occur.

                      <br>Winning bets on fixed odds between 10:06 am to 11:35 am: 2nd rule 4 will apply.
                      <br>Winning bets on fixed odds between 9:00 am to 10:05 am: 2nd rule 4 will apply but the sum of the deduction
                      will not exceed 90p.
                      <br>If a horse comes under Starter’s Orders but refuses to race, the bet will be a loser. In all horse races
                      where a runner is withdrawn, or adjudged not to have started - and therefore been declared a Non-Runner by the
                      starter - stakes on that selection will be refunded. (The exception to this being Ante Post bets). Bets on the
                      remaining runners in that race, taken at Early Prices or at Board Prices prior to withdrawal, will be subject to
                      a deduction.
                      <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-primary f-1">Reserves</h4>
                      <p class="f-1">Some races contain reserves, who may or may not be priced in our early prices lists. The finishing position of
                        any of these reserves will count regardless of whether they are priced or not.
                        <br>If a reserve horse is offered with an early price and becomes a non-runner, then normal Rule 4 deduction
                        will be applied to all bets struck prior to the non-runner as a result of the withdrawal.</p>
                      <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-primary f-1">Forecasts</h4>
                      <p class="f-1">A Straight Forecast is a bet where you name two selections to finish 1st and 2nd in the correct order for a
                        specified event.
                        <br>A Reverse Forecast is a bet where you name two selections to finish 1st and 2nd in any order for a specific
                        event.
                        <br>A Combination Forecast is a bet where you choose three or more selections with any of these to finish 1st
                        and 2nd for a specific event.
                        <br>Forecasts will be accepted only in races of three or more runners and will be settled in accordance with the
                        officially declared SP Computer Forecast Dividend. In races with less than three runners the forecast bet will
                        be declared void. If one of the selections becomes a non-runner in a forecast bet, the total stake will be
                        placed on the other remaining selection as a win single bet at SP.
                        <br><br>Example: £1 Forecast AB, where B is a non-runner, bet will be a £1 win single on A
                        In races where a horse finishes alone and no forecast dividend is returned then all forecast bets nominating
                        that horse to finish first will be settled as a Win single at SP on the winning horse. All other forecast bets
                        in the race are lost.
                        <br>In a Combination Forecast, where a selection becomes a non-runner, the total stake of the bet will be
                        divided equally between the possible forecast combinations, using the remaining selections and the forecasts,
                        including the non-runner, becoming singles.
                        <br><br>Example 2: A combination forecast (6 bets, total stake £6) ABC, where C is a non-runner, will be settled
                        as:
                        <br>- AC -&gt; single on A
                        <br>- AB -&gt; bet stands

                        <br>- CB -&gt; single on B
                        <br>In the event of a dead heat, separate dividends will be declared for all the horses involved in the dead
                        heat and forecast.
                        Unnamed favourites are not accepted for forecast betting.</p>
                      <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-primary f-1">Tricasts</h4>
                      <p class="f-1">A Tricast is a bet where you name the first three selections to finish first, second and third in the correct
                        order for a specified race, in races where a Computer Forecast Dividend is declared.
                        <br>A Combination Tricast is a bet where you name three selections to finish first, second and third in any
                        order.
                        <br>Any winning Tricast is paid out according to the official Computer Tricast return which is declared to a £1
                        stake.
                        <br>Tricasts are offered on all handicap races in which there are eight or more runners declared. If there are
                        less than 8 runners – all bets will be void.
                        If one of the selections becomes a non-runner in a tricast bet, the bet will be settled as a forecast on the
                        remaining selections in the order they were selected. If two of the selections become non-runners in a tricast,
                        the bet will be settled as a win single on the remaining runner.
                        <br><br>Example 1: £1 Tricast ABC, where B is a non-runner, will be settled as a £1 Forecast AC.
                        <br><br>Example 2: £1 Combination Tricast ABC, where C is a non-runner, will be settled as:
                        <br>- ABC -&gt; bet stands as AB
                        <br>- ACB -&gt; bet stands as AB
                        <br>- BAC -&gt; bet stands as BA

                        <br>- CBA -&gt; bet stands as BA
                        <br>In the event of two or more horses dead-heating for first, second or third place then separate dividends
                        will be declared and paid to each qualifying tricast. In fixed price tricasts the full odds will be paid with
                        the stake being split according to the number of horses which dead-heat.
                        Unnamed favourites are not accepted for tricast betting.
                        <br>Tricasts are accepted for singles only.</p>
                      <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-primary f-1">Favourites</h4>
                      <p class="f-1">Bets on First and Second favourites are accepted win-only at starting price. Early prices or board prices cannot
                        be taken on unnamed favourites.
                        <br>The favourite is the horse quoted at the shortest odds in the official starting price.
                        <br>The second favourite is the horse quoted at the next shortest price.
                        <br>If two horses are quoted at the same odds and these odds are shorter than those quoted against any other,
                        then these two are equal first favourite and equal second favourite.
                        <br>If two or more co-favourites are selected, the stake will be divided equally between them and paid at full
                        odds.</p>

                      <p class="f-1">Predict the result of a given race excluding a Favourite horse. The finishing position of the Favourite horse
                        will be ignored for bets placed on this market. For example, a bet placed on Cue Card without Don Cossack
                        (favourite) will win if Cue Card wins the race or finishes second to Don Cossack. The bet will have lost in all
                        other circumstances.
                        <br>In markets where we offer 'Betting Without' a nominated selection, the place terms will be based on the
                        remaining number of runners excluding the nominated selection.
                        <br>Any each-way terms advertised are settled on the actual number of runners who take part in the race,
                        excluding the 'without' selection.
                        <br>Any rule 4 deductions will still apply and will be based on the price of the withdrawn runner in that market
                        at the time of withdrawal.
                        <br>Betting Without bets are settled ignoring the finishing position of the nominated ‘without’ runner. Where
                        the nominated ‘without’ selection is withdrawn before the start of a race, all bets on any of the field in this
                        market stand.

                      <p class="f-1">Place Only 2 - Predict a horse to finish in one of the first two places. Place only bets are accepted on horse

                        <br>In the event of a horse being withdrawn, not under starter’s orders, stakes on that selection will be
                        returned. Bets for the remaining horses in the race will be subject to a deduction in accordance with the Rule 4
                        table below based on the price in the Place Only market of the withdrawn horse(s) at the time of withdrawal.
                      </p><br>If 2 or more horses are withdrawn, the total deduction will not exceed 90p.
                      <br>If the selected horse is withdrawn from a race after coming under starter’s orders, bets placed on that
                      horse will have lost as the horse will be deemed to have been a participant in the race.
                      <br>In the event of non-runners, the number of places paid will remain the same, unless the number of
                      runners in the race is equal to or less than the number of places paid, in which case all bets will be void.
                      This market is settled on the official place terms of the race. If an 8 horse race with each way terms of 3
                      places is reduced to a race of 7 or less runners, we will still pay 3 places on the Place Only market.
